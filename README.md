### 👋 Hi!  I'm Andrew.  

I currently lead data, analytics and machine learning teams at [Renaissance Learning](https://www.renaissance.com/).  

Throughout my career I've built tools to help teachers and school system leaders use data and information systems for improvement.  I started as a public school teacher in [the Bronx](https://insideschools.org/school/09X028) through Teach for America, helped found a college prep [high school](https://kippnj.org/schools/kipp-nca/) in Newark, and led data, research and technology for the [Newark Public Schools](https://www.nps.k12.nj.us/).  

I had the pleasure of growing the data function at [Alloy](https://www.alloy.com/about) from the ground up, where I led the machine learning, data warehousing and data analysis teams, serving models in production that combatted identity fraud in the banking sector.

I'm deeply passionate about public education, and dream of a future with a more effective and more equitable systems of schools.  In Newark, I had a [front-row seat](https://www.the74million.org/article/the-prize-the-unwritten-appendix-by-those-inside-newarks-improving-schools/) for a particularly bold and contentious period in school reform - you might have [read about it](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled)!   

I'm a product of the [University of Chicago](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/).  I live in Princeton, NJ with my amazing, talented wife Kerry and our four children.  

I'm the author and maintainer of several open source educational tools, particularly [njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), which wraps the hodgepodge of NJ educational data into a consistent, tidy interface you can work with in R.

Ten years on, I'm still carrying a torch for [google reader 🪦](https://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network).  In the absence of the magic "share with friends" button, I'm the proprieter of [weird charts](http://weirdcharts.com), a love letter to strange and/or captivating charts that I've encountered on the web.  I'm also playing around with [safe to eat](https://almartin82.github.io/safe-to-eat/) a podcast sharing and curation project.  

Email at [almartin@gmail.com](mailto:almartin@gmail.com) is best if you'd like to say hi!  And if you'd like to send me unsolicited sales messages, there's always [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinandrewl/)
