### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!  I'm Andrew.  

I currently lead data, analytics and machine learning teams at [Renaissance Learning](https://www.renaissance.com/).  

Throughout my career I've built tools to help teachers and school system leaders use data and information systems for improvement.  I started as a public school teacher in [the Bronx](https://insideschools.org/school/09X028) through Teach for America, helped found a college prep [high school](https://kippnj.org/schools/kipp-nca/) in Newark, and led data, research and technology for the [Newark Public Schools](https://www.nps.k12.nj.us/).  

I had the pleasure of growing the data function at [Alloy](https://www.alloy.com/about) from the ground up, where I led the machine learning, data warehousing and data analysis, serving models in production that identified fraud in the banking sector.

I'm deeply passionate about public education and dream of a future with a more effective and more equitable systems of schools.  In Newark, I had a [front-row seat](https://www.the74million.org/article/the-prize-the-unwritten-appendix-by-those-inside-newarks-improving-schools/) for a particularly bold and contentious period in school reform - you might have [read about it](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled)!   

I'm a product of the [University of Chicago](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/).  I live in Princeton, NJ with my amazing, talented wife Kerry and our four children.  

I'm the author and maintainer of [njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), an open-source project that creates a consistent interface into 20+ years of NJ educational data, written in R.

Drop me a line at almartin at gmail.com if you'd like to say hi!
