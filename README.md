### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!  I'm Andrew.  

I currently lead Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) teams at [Audible](https://www.audiblecareers.com/technology) in Newark.  We support engineers, scientists and internal users bringing machine learning and AI applications to production.  Audible and I are both :star_struck: about books, podcasts and the city of Newark. 
 It's great!  Come work with us!

Prior to Audible, I had the pleasure of growing the data function at [Alloy](https://www.alloy.com/about) from the ground up, where I led the machine learning, data warehousing and data analysis teams, serving models in production that identified fraud and money laundering in the financial system.  I led the platform organization at [Renaissance](https://www.renaissance.com/), solving interoperability and identity problems, and scaling LLMs for back-office use cases.  

I'm deeply passionate about public education, and dream of a future with a more effective and more equitable systems of schools.  In Newark, I had a [front-row seat](https://www.the74million.org/article/the-prize-the-unwritten-appendix-by-those-inside-newarks-improving-schools/) for a particularly bold and contentious period in school reform - you might have [read about it](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled)!   I started my career as a public school teacher in [the Bronx](https://insideschools.org/school/09X028) through Teach for America, helped found a college prep [high school](https://kippnj.org/schools/kipp-nca/) in Newark, and led data, research and technology for the [Newark Public Schools](https://www.nps.k12.nj.us/).  

I'm a product of the [University of Chicago](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/).  I live in Princeton, NJ with my amazing, talented wife Kerry and our four children.  

I'm the author and maintainer of several open source educational tools, particularly [njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), which wraps the hodgepodge of NJ educational data into a consistent, tidy interface you can work with in R.

Ten years on, I'm still carrying a torch for [google reader](https://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network)ðŸª¦.  In the absence of the magic "share with friends" button, I'm the proprieter of [weird charts](http://weirdcharts.com), a love letter to strange and/or captivating charts that I've encountered on the web.  I'm also running a podcast curation and sharing project, [safe to eat](https://almartin82.github.io/safe-to-eat/).
